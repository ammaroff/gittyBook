Well, it's hard to say that you will be an Azure IoT Edge master once you are done with this guide. But at least you will have enough knowledge to continue the path on your own. IoT solutions come in different flavours spanning all the spectrum from virtually no code solutions like [accelerators ](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/features/iot-accelerators/)to pure custom solutions involving lots of coding. IoT Edge fits somewhere in the middle. There is lots of out of the box components we can use as is plus the option to write custom modules to fine tune the result or fill in the gaps.

Let's have a roadmap first.

#### Basics

1. [Setup development environment](introduction/setup-development-environment.md)
2. [Introduction to Azure IoT hub](introduction/introduction-to-azure-iot-hub.md)
3. [Hello IoT Edge](iot-edge-basics/hello-iot-edge-with-marketplace-modules.md)
4. [Deploy marketplace modules](iot-edge-basics/deploy-marketplace-modules.md)
5. [Develop custom modules](iot-edge-basics/develop-custom-modules.md)
6. [Development and debugging story](iot-edge-basics/local-development-and-debugging.md)
7. [CI/CD](iot-edge-basics/ci-cd-on-the-edge.md)

#### Integration with Azure Services
